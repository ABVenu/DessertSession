### Part A Session Flow Breakdown

#### Session Flow

1. **Recap of Day 2 (0:00 - 0:10)**

   - Start the session by reviewing key concepts from Day 2, focusing on version control and basic Git commands.
   - Address any questions students may have to ensure understanding before moving on to new material.

2. **Creating a GitHub Repository (0:10 - 0:25)**

   - Explain what a GitHub repository is and its significance in project management and collaboration.
   - Demonstrate how to create a new repository on GitHub:
     - Log in to GitHub.
     - Click on the "+" icon and select "New repository."
     - Fill in the repository name, description, and choose visibility (public or private).
     - Optionally, check "Initialize this repository with a README."
     - Click the "Create repository" button.
   - Emphasize the importance of README files in providing project context.

3. **Pushing Local Changes to GitHub (0:25 - 0:40)**

   - Discuss the steps involved in pushing local changes to GitHub:
     - Link the local repository to the GitHub repository using the command:
       ```bash
       git remote add origin <repository-url>
       ```
     - Stage changes using `git add`.
     - Commit changes using `git commit -m "Your commit message"`.
     - Push the changes to GitHub using:
       ```bash
       git push -u origin main
       ```
   - Highlight the importance of proper commit messages for project history.

4. **Understanding the Git Workflow (0:40 - 0:55)**

   - Introduce the Git workflow:
     - Discuss the stages of a typical workflow: working directory, staging area, and repository.
     - Emphasize the importance of staging changes before committing.
   - Explain the collaborative nature of Git and how it facilitates teamwork.

5. **Collaborating on GitHub (0:55 - 1:05)**

   - Discuss features that support collaboration on GitHub:
     - **Issues**: Tracking tasks, bugs, and feature requests.
     - **Pull Requests**: Proposing changes and requesting feedback.
     - **Code Reviews**: Encouraging peer review to maintain code quality.
   - Share examples of how teams use these features effectively.

6. **Hands-On Exercise (1:05 - 1:20)**

   - Allow students to practice:
     - Creating a GitHub repository for their ongoing project.
     - Making local changes and pushing those changes to GitHub.
   - Encourage students to explore the collaboration features discussed.

7. **Q&A and Wrap-Up (1:20 - 1:30)**
   - Open the floor for any final questions.
   - Summarize key takeaways from the session.
   - Remind students about assignments and provide a preview of Day 4 content.

### Part B Instructor Session Content/Notes

#### Objective:

The goal of this session is to familiarize students with creating GitHub repositories, pushing changes from local repositories, understanding the Git workflow, and exploring collaboration features on GitHub.

#### Key Concepts to Cover:

1. **GitHub Repository**: Explain its role in version control and collaboration. Highlight the significance of README files.

2. **Pushing Changes**: Ensure students understand how to link their local repository to GitHub and the steps to push changes. Emphasize the use of clear commit messages.

3. **Git Workflow**: Explain the transition of changes through different stages in Git (working directory, staging area, and repository). Highlight the benefits of staging changes before committing.

4. **Collaboration Features**: Discuss how issues, pull requests, and code reviews facilitate teamwork and project management on GitHub.

#### Teaching Tips:

- Use a live demo to walk through the process of creating a GitHub repository and pushing changes.
