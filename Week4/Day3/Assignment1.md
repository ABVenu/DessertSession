# GitHub Repository and Collaboration

1. **Create Your First Repository**

   - Create a new GitHub repository for a personal project (e.g., a blog, a portfolio site, or a simple application). Include the following:
     - A descriptive README.md file that explains the purpose of your project, its features, and how to set it up locally.
     - Initialize the repository with at least one file (like a `.txt` or `.md` file) describing your project.
   - **Tools to Use**: GitHub, Visual Studio Code (or any text editor).

2. **Push Local Changes**

   - Clone the repository you created in Assignment 1 to your local machine.
   - Add at least two new files (e.g., additional documentation, a sample code file) to the cloned repository.
   - Stage and commit these changes with appropriate messages.
   - Push the changes back to the GitHub repository.
   - **Tools to Use**: Git, GitHub Desktop (optional).

3. **Write an Issue**

   - Create a new issue in your GitHub repository related to a feature you plan to implement or a bug you need to address. Include:
     - A title for the issue.
     - A detailed description of the issue, including steps to reproduce it or details on the feature you want to implement.
   - **Tools to Use**: GitHub.

4. **Create a Pull Request**

   - After pushing your local changes from Assignment 2, create a pull request in your GitHub repository:
     - Title your pull request appropriately.
     - Write a description explaining what changes you made and why.
   - Review your own pull request and merge it into the main branch.
   - **Tools to Use**: GitHub.

5. **Document Your Project**

   - Expand your README.md file to include:
     - Installation instructions for your project.
     - Usage examples or screenshots (if applicable).
     - A section on how others can contribute to your project.
   - Ensure that your README is well-organized and easy to understand.
   - **Tools to Use**: GitHub, Visual Studio Code (or any text editor).

6. **Collaborative Project**
   - Form groups of 3-4 students and collaboratively create a new GitHub repository for a group project (e.g., a simple web application, a game, or a shared document). Each group should:
     - Assign roles (e.g., project manager, developer, designer).
     - Create a detailed project plan in the README.md, outlining responsibilities and deadlines.
     - Use issues to track tasks and discuss ideas among group members.
     - Ensure each member pushes their changes to the repository and documents their contributions in the README.
   - **Tools to Use**: GitHub, Visual Studio Code (or any text editor), Trello (for project management).
