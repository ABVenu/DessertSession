#### **1. What is Project Management?**

**Definition**:  
Project management is the process of planning, organizing, and executing tasks to achieve specific goals within a set time frame. It helps keep everything on track, whether you're creating a website, organizing an event, or building a product.

**Why is Project Management Important?**:

- It keeps everyone organized and makes sure each person knows what they are supposed to do.
- It helps use **resources effectively**, like time, money, or skills.
- It provides **clear direction** and avoids confusion about who is responsible for what.

**Examples**:

- **Building a Website**: To create a website, you need to design it, write content, and code it. Without proper planning, it’s easy to get confused about responsibilities and deadlines.
- **Non-Software Project**: Imagine planning a party. You have to pick a location, arrange food, send invites, etc. Without a plan, things can get disorganized.

#### **2. Phases of Project Management**

There are **five key phases** that help guide a project from start to finish. Let's break these down:

1. **Initiation**:

   - This is where the project starts.
   - You define what the project is all about—what is the **purpose**?
   - Example: If you're building a website, the purpose might be to give information about a product or service.
   - It’s important to define a **scope**, which means figuring out what will be included in the project and what won’t be.

2. **Planning**:

   - This phase is all about **breaking down tasks** and deciding how to do the project.
   - Example: For a website, you might plan tasks like designing pages, writing content, coding, and testing.
   - **Tools** can help you visualize the tasks. For example, tools like **Trello** or **Notion** allow you to create cards for each task and track them.

3. **Execution**:

   - This is when the **actual work** gets done.
   - You need to make sure that everyone knows their tasks and deadlines.
   - Good communication is essential so that everyone knows what progress is being made and any challenges faced.

4. **Monitoring**:

   - While working on the project, you must make sure things are progressing **as planned**.
   - You need to **track progress** using checklists or progress reports.
   - Example: If a webpage was supposed to be done by Friday, check to see if it’s actually done and what might be causing delays if it’s not.

5. **Closing**:
   - This phase is about completing the project.
   - It includes collecting feedback, reviewing how things went, and celebrating the completion.
   - It’s important to think about what went well and what could be improved for next time.

**Example Project**:  
Think about a simple project like building a portfolio website.

- **Initiation**: What will be on the website? Pages like "Home," "About Me," "Projects," and "Contact."
- **Planning**: Break down tasks—design layout, write the "About Me" content, add images.
- **Execution**: You start working on these tasks.
- **Monitoring**: You check to see if each page is being completed on time.
- **Closing**: Review and make sure everything looks good and works properly.

#### **3. Key Concepts in Project Management**

**Scope**:

- Scope defines **what work needs to be done**.
- It’s crucial to understand what’s **included** in the project and what is **not**.
- Example: For a website, including a blog might be part of the scope, but creating a full-fledged e-commerce system might not be.

**Time**:

- Every project has **deadlines** and a **schedule**.
- **Milestones** are small checkpoints that show progress. They help keep the project on track.
- Example: The deadline to complete the homepage might be "by the end of Week 1."

**Cost**:

- Cost includes all expenses, like tools, hiring people, and purchasing resources.
- Example: Hiring a graphic designer might be part of the project cost.

**Quality**:

- Quality ensures that the end product meets certain standards.
- Example: A website should look good on all devices—whether it's a mobile phone, a tablet, or a desktop.

**Stakeholders**:

- **Stakeholders** are people who are affected by or have an interest in the project.
- Example: If you are creating a website for a school, the stakeholders could include students, teachers, and parents.

#### **4. Real-Life Scenario Walkthrough**

To understand how these phases and concepts work together, let’s look at a simple scenario:

**Example Project**: **Building a Website for a Bakery**

- **Initiation**: What’s the purpose? To help people know about the bakery, view products, and get contact information.
- **Planning**: Define tasks—Create "About Us" page, add a product gallery, and build a contact form.
- **Execution**: Assign tasks—One person designs the layout, another writes the content, and another codes it.
- **Monitoring**: Use a checklist—Is the "About Us" page complete? Are product images added?
- **Closing**: Test the website to make sure everything is working correctly.

#### **5. Project Planning Basics**

**Breaking Down a Project**:

- Any big project can be broken down into smaller, more manageable tasks.
- Example: Instead of thinking about the whole website, break it down into individual parts like the **Home Page**, **About Page**, and **Contact Form**.

**Milestones and Deadlines**:

- **Milestones** are small goals that help track how well the project is progressing.
- Example: One milestone might be to complete the homepage by "Day 3."

**Tools for Project Planning**:

- Tools like **Trello** help organize tasks visually.
- You can create **cards** for each task (like "Design Home Page") and move them from **"To Do"** to **"In Progress"** to **"Done"**.

#### **6. Group Activity: Project Plan Creation**

**Activity**:

- You worked in a group to create a basic project plan for building a website.
- You defined the **scope**—what the website would have.
- You **broke down the project into smaller tasks**.
- You also set a few **milestones** to help keep everything on track.

**Things to Remember**:

- Every project is easier to manage when broken down into smaller steps.
- Communicating effectively within the team helps get things done smoothly.
- Using simple tools like Trello makes organizing tasks much easier.

#### **7. Closing Remarks and Next Steps**

**Key Takeaways**:

- **Project Management** helps to organize tasks and make sure things are done on time and with good quality.
- The **five phases** of a project—Initiation, Planning, Execution, Monitoring, and Closing—guide a project from start to finish.
- Concepts like **scope**, **time**, and **stakeholders** are key to understanding what a project involves and who it affects.
- **Tools** like Trello can make managing tasks simple and visual.

**Next Steps**:

- Tomorrow, we’ll learn about **Agile** and **Scrum**—which are ways of managing projects that are especially useful in software development.
- We’ll also learn about **GitHub**, a tool that helps with **collaboration** and **version control** when multiple people work on the same project.
