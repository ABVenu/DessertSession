### Part B Instructor Session Content/Notes

#### **1. Introduction to Project Management (20 minutes)**

**Goal**: Introduce students to what project management is and why it is crucial for success in both technical and non-technical projects.

**Talking Points**:

- **Definition**:

  - Project management is the process of planning, organizing, and executing tasks to meet specific goals within a defined time frame. Emphasize the importance of coordination to meet objectives.
  - Example Definition: "Project management involves using skills, knowledge, and tools to guide a team to achieve specific project goals."

- **Importance**:
  - It helps **organize work**, avoid chaos, and ensures all team members know what they are responsible for.
  - Crucial for managing **resources effectively**—whether those resources are time, money, or people.
  - Discuss examples:
    - **Software Project**: Creating a web application involves coding, designing, testing, and deploying. Without planning, there could be confusion about who is responsible for each aspect.
    - **Non-software Project**: Building a new store requires several stages, from planning the layout to construction, inventory, and opening. Without a structured approach, projects might face delays, miscommunication, and budget overruns.

**Suggested Engagement**:

- Ask students to share a small project they worked on previously (e.g., a school project or organizing an event). How did they manage tasks, and what challenges did they face?

#### **2. Phases of Project Management (20 minutes)**

**Goal**: Familiarize students with the different phases of project management to help them understand the structured approach needed for successful completion of projects.

**Talking Points**:

- **Initiation**:

  - Identify the **purpose of the project**. What problem are you trying to solve?
  - Examples: Building a website to provide information about an organization.
  - Define the scope and set expectations. Explain how a well-defined scope prevents "scope creep," where extra tasks get added on without proper planning.

- **Planning**:

  - Planning includes breaking down work into **tasks** and creating a timeline.
  - Mention tools for task organization (like **Trello, Notion**).
  - Example of breaking down tasks for a website:
    - Designing layout.
    - Writing content.
    - Coding different sections.
    - Testing functionality.

- **Execution**:

  - This is where the actual work happens.
  - It’s crucial to ensure everyone on the team is aware of their **responsibilities**.
  - Emphasize the importance of regular communication to ensure that everyone is aligned.

- **Monitoring**:

  - Discuss the importance of tracking progress.
  - Introduce the concept of **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**—how do we measure the project's success?
  - Tools to help monitor progress include Gantt charts or simple checklists.

- **Closing**:
  - Describe the importance of officially closing a project.
  - Collect feedback and review what went well, and what didn’t. Highlight the importance of **retrospectives** to improve future projects.

**Suggested Engagement**:

- After covering each phase, ask the students:
  - "Which of these phases do you think is the most challenging, and why?"

#### **3. Key Concepts in Project Management (15 minutes)**

**Goal**: Introduce core project management concepts to help students understand what must be managed effectively throughout a project.

**Talking Points**:

- **Scope**:

  - Defines what is to be done.
  - Example: If you're developing a website, what features should be included, and which are outside the scope?
  - Stress the importance of avoiding **scope creep**—additional features being added during development without proper planning.

- **Time**:

  - **Deadlines and Scheduling**: How do you ensure the project is completed on time?
  - **Milestones**: Small, measurable goals that show progress toward the final objective.
  - Example: Finish the landing page by the end of Week 1.

- **Cost**:

  - Covers budgeting for resources, tools, or personnel.
  - Example: What will be the cost of hiring a designer or purchasing a tool?

- **Quality**:

  - Meeting the required standard.
  - Example: Ensure a website works properly across different browsers and devices.

- **Stakeholder Management**:
  - Discuss identifying stakeholders (anyone impacted by the project).
  - **Stakeholders** might include customers, team members, or supervisors.
  - Emphasize managing expectations and communicating effectively with stakeholders.

**Suggested Engagement**:

- Ask students to identify stakeholders in a basic project (e.g., developing a website for a school). Discuss what each stakeholder’s concerns might be.

#### **4. Real-Life Scenario Walkthrough (15 minutes)**

**Goal**: Provide a practical example of applying project management concepts to an actual project.

**Talking Points**:

- **Example Scenario**: Building a simple website for a bakery.
  - **Initiation**: Identify the goal—build an online presence for the bakery.
  - **Planning**: Define tasks—create pages for "About Us," products, and contact.
  - **Execution**: Assign tasks—one person writes content, another designs, another codes.
  - **Monitoring**: Use a checklist to track which pages are complete.
  - **Closing**: Test the website and gather feedback from the bakery owner.

**Suggested Engagement**:

  - Divide students into groups of 3-4.
  - Assign them a project—building a small website (e.g., a personal portfolio site or a simple informational website).

- **Activity Tasks**:
  - **Define Scope**: Each group should write down what they want to achieve.
  - **Break Down Tasks**: Students should break the project into smaller components (e.g., homepage, about section, contact form).
  - **Identify Milestones**: Example milestones could be "Complete homepage design by Day 3" or "Add all text content by Day 5".

**Guidance**:

- Walk around and **assist groups** if they struggle.
- Ask prompting questions like, "How can you break this task down even further?" or "What is the priority for this milestone?"

**Wrap-Up**:

- Ask a few groups to present their project plan.
- Provide constructive feedback, focusing on whether their plan is **specific, achievable, and well-structured**.
