### Part B Instructor Session Content/Notes

#### **1. Introduction to Version Control**

- Emphasize that version control systems allow multiple people to work on projects simultaneously without overwriting each other’s changes.
- Highlight real-world scenarios where version control can save time and avoid conflicts, such as collaborative coding, writing documents, or managing design files.

#### **2. Introduction to GitHub**

- Explain that GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control.
- Mention that it not only stores code but also serves as a social network for developers, allowing for collaboration and showcasing work.

#### **3. Setting Up Git**

- Walk through the installation process step-by-step for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- When configuring Git, remind students that using their actual names and email addresses will be beneficial for collaboration later on.

#### **4. Basic Git Commands**

- Provide a live demonstration of each command.
  - **`git init`**: Show how to create a new repository.
  - **`git add`**: Demonstrate how to stage changes before committing.
  - **`git commit`**: Explain the significance of commit messages; encourage meaningful messages.
