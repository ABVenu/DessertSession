#### AI Instruction:

- Use **clear and specific prompts** when learning about HTML tags, attributes, and their uses. For example, you can ask Gen AI: "What tag is used to create a heading in HTML?" or "How do I create navigation links in HTML?"
- Apply what you have learned from the prompts to fill in the missing HTML tags and attributes.
- Be sure to double-check your code for proper structure and tag nesting.

## Dice Roll Simulator

**Problem Statement:**

Create a simple dice roll simulator where the user can roll one or two dice. The following events should be handled:

1. **Click Event (Single Die):** When the user clicks the "Roll One Die" button, a random number between 1 and 6 should be generated, and the corresponding die face should be displayed.
2. **Click Event (Two Dice):** When the user clicks the "Roll Two Dice" button, two random numbers between 1 and 6 should be generated, and both dice faces should be displayed. The total result should also be shown.
3. **Animation:** Add a rolling animation for the dice, where the faces quickly change for about 1-2 seconds before stopping on the final result.
4. **Hover Event:** When the user hovers over a button, the button background color should change.
5. **Alert Event:** If the user rolls double sixes (two 6s), display an alert that says "You rolled double sixes!"

**Requirements:**

- Implement a basic interface with two buttons: one for rolling one die, and another for rolling two dice.
- Use images or styled HTML elements to represent each face of the dice.
- Implement random number generation and an animation effect.
- Use event handlers for click, hover, and alert events as described.
