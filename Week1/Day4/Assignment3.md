#### AI Instruction:

- Use **clear and specific prompts** when learning about HTML tags, attributes, and their uses. For example, you can ask Gen AI: "What tag is used to create a heading in HTML?" or "How do I create navigation links in HTML?"
- Apply what you have learned from the prompts to fill in the missing HTML tags and attributes.
- Be sure to double-check your code for proper structure and tag nesting.

## Create Multiple Events (Click, Prompt, Mouseover, Keydown)

**Problem Statement:**

Create a page with the following components: a button, an image, and a paragraph element. The following events should be handled:

1. **Click Event:** When the user clicks the button, a prompt should appear asking for their name. After entering the name, display a welcome message inside the paragraph element, like "Welcome, [User's Name]".
2. **Mouseover Event:** When the user hovers over the image, change the image's border color to blue and display a message below the image saying "You are hovering over the image!".
3. **Mouseout Event:** When the user moves the mouse away from the image, reset the border color and hide the hover message.
4. **Keydown Event:** When the user presses any key while focused on the input field, log the key pressed to the console.
5. **Double-click Event:** If the user double-clicks the paragraph with the welcome message, it should change its text to "Have a nice day!".
6. **Context Menu Event:** If the user right-clicks on the image (to trigger the context menu), an alert should pop up saying "Right-click disabled on this image".

**Requirements:**

- Handle the `click` event to prompt the user and display the name.
- Handle `mouseover` and `mouseout` events to change the image's border color and show/hide the message.
- Handle the `keydown` event to log the key pressed.
- Use the `dblclick` event to update the paragraph message on double-click.
- Use the `contextmenu` event to prevent right-click functionality on the image.
