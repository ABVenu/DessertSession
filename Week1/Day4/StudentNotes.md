### Lecture Name: Building Basic App with AI

---

### **1. Introduction**

- **Objective:**
  - Today, we will learn about JavaScript events and how they make web pages interactive.
  - We will also explore how AI can help us understand and use these events effectively.

---

### **2. Learning Basic JavaScript Events with AI**

- **Objective:** Understand and use basic JavaScript events like `change`, `click`, and `mouseover`.

  - **Introduction to JavaScript Events:**

    - **Explanation:**
      - JavaScript events occur when users interact with web elements. For example, clicking a button or moving the mouse over an element can trigger events.
    - **Implementation:**
      - We will add event listeners to HTML elements to respond to events like `change`, `click`, and `mouseover`. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

    ```javascript
    // Example: Adding a click event listener to a button
    document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function () {
      alert("Button clicked!");
    });

    // Example: Adding a change event listener to an input field
    document.getElementById("myInput").addEventListener("change", function () {
      alert("Input value changed!");
    });

    // Example: Adding a mouseover event listener to a div
    document.getElementById("myDiv").addEventListener("mouseover", function () {
      alert("Mouse is over the div!");
    });
    ```

### **3. Using Alerts with JavaScript Events**

- **Objective:** Learn how to use `alert` to give feedback or debug JavaScript code in response to events.

  - **Introduction to Alerts:**

    - **Explanation:**
      - The `alert` function shows a pop-up message to users. It can also be used to debug your code by displaying messages.
    - **Implementation:**
      - We will use `alert` to show messages when specific events occur. For example:

    ```javascript
    // Alert when a button is clicked
    document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function () {
      alert("Button clicked!");
    });
    ```

### **4. Combining Events with HTML Elements**

- **Objective:** Use JavaScript events with HTML elements to create interactive web pages.

  - **Combining Events and HTML:**

    - **Explanation:**
      - By attaching event listeners to HTML elements, we can make our web pages interactive. For example, you can make a button respond to clicks or a text field respond to changes.
    - **Implementation:**
      - We will create interactive HTML elements and attach event listeners to them. For example:

    ```html
    <!-- HTML Button -->
    <button id="myButton">Click me</button>

    <!-- JavaScript to handle the click event -->
    <script>
      document
        .getElementById("myButton")
        .addEventListener("click", function () {
          alert("Button clicked!");
        });
    </script>
    ```

### **5. Closing**

- **Summary:**
  - We covered JavaScript events like `change`, `click`, and `mouseover`, and learned to use `alert` for feedback.
  - We also saw how to combine these events with HTML elements to make web pages interactive.
- **Encouragement:**
  - Practice using JavaScript events in your own projects to make them more interactive.
  - Use AI tools to explore more advanced event handling techniques and troubleshoot any issues.
