#### **2. Learning Basic JavaScript Events with AI**

- **Objective:** Understand and apply basic JavaScript events.

  - **Introduction to JavaScript Events:**

    - **Explanation:**
      - JavaScript events are crucial for creating interactive experiences on the web. They allow scripts to respond to user actions.
    - **Implementation:**
      - **Prompt for `change` Event:**
        "How do you use the `change` event to detect changes in an input field or dropdown menu?"
          - Explain the use of the `change` event in forms or input elements, demonstrating how it can trigger a function when the value of an input changes.
      - **Prompt for `click` Event:**
        "What is the syntax for attaching a `click` event to a button, and how can it be used to trigger a function?"
          - Show how to attach a `click` event to buttons and other elements, and how to define the function that gets triggered.
      - **Prompt for `mouseover` Event:**
        "How can you use the `mouseover` event to change the appearance of an element when the mouse pointer is over it?"
          - Discuss how the `mouseover` event can be used to modify the style or content of an element when a user hovers over it.

    - **Cross-Questioning Prompts:**
      - **Prompt for Event Usage:**
        "What are some common use cases for each of these events (`change`, `click`, `mouseover`)? How do they enhance user interaction?"
          - Discuss practical examples and scenarios where each event type is useful.
      - **Prompt for Event Handling:**
        "How does attaching multiple event handlers to the same element affect the behavior? Provide examples."
          - Explore how multiple event listeners on the same element can interact and affect each other.

#### **3. Using Alerts with JavaScript Events**

- **Objective:** Learn to use `alert` for debugging and feedback.

  - **Introduction to Alerts:**

    - **Explanation:**
      - The `alert` function is a simple way to communicate with users or debug code by displaying messages in a pop-up box.
    - **Implementation:**
      - **Prompt for Alert Integration:**
        "How can you integrate `alert` into event handlers to notify users about specific actions, such as clicking a button or changing a selection?"
          - Demonstrate how to use `alert` within event handlers to provide immediate feedback or debugging information.

    - **Cross-Questioning Prompts:**
      - **Prompt for Alert Utility:**
        "In what scenarios is using `alert` appropriate, and when might it be better to use other methods of providing feedback, such as `console.log`?"
          - Discuss the pros and cons of using `alert` versus other methods like `console.log` for debugging and user feedback.

#### **4. Combining Events with HTML Elements**

- **Objective:** Apply JavaScript events to HTML elements to create interactive experiences.

  - **Combining Events and HTML:**

    - **Explanation:**
      - Attaching event listeners to HTML elements allows for dynamic and interactive web pages.
    - **Implementation:**
      - **Prompt for Event Integration:**
        "How do you attach event listeners to different HTML elements (e.g., buttons, input fields, divs) and what are some practical examples?"
          - Guide students through attaching event listeners to various HTML elements and handling different events.
      - **Prompt for Function Linking:**
        "How do you define and link JavaScript functions to respond to events like `click`, `change`, and `mouseover`?"
