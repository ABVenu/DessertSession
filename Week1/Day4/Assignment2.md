#### AI Instruction:

- Use **clear and specific prompts** when learning about HTML tags, attributes, and their uses. For example, you can ask Gen AI: "What tag is used to create a heading in HTML?" or "How do I create navigation links in HTML?"
- Apply what you have learned from the prompts to fill in the missing HTML tags and attributes.
- Be sure to double-check your code for proper structure and tag nesting.

## Create Multiple Events (Input, Click, and Change)

**Problem Statement:**

Create a simple form with an input field, a button, and a paragraph element. The following events should be handled:

1. **Input Event:** When the user types in the input field, the text inside the paragraph should update in real-time, showing what the user is typing.
2. **Click Event:** When the user clicks a button, the input field should be cleared, and the paragraph should show a message like "Input cleared!"
3. **Change Event:** When the input field loses focus (i.e., the user clicks outside the field), show an alert with the current value of the input field.
4. **Double-click Event:** If the user double-clicks the paragraph, the text color of the paragraph should change to red.

**Requirements:**

- Use the `input` event for real-time updates in the paragraph.
- Use the `click` event for clearing the input and updating the paragraph.
- Use the `change` event to alert the current input value when the input field loses focus.
- Use the `dblclick` event to change the paragraph's text color.
