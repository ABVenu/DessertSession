### **5. Styling the Website with CSS**

- **Key CSS Properties to Apply:**

  - Use `padding` and `margin` to give space around your elements.
  - Use Flexbox to align sections vertically or horizontally for a clean layout.

- **CSS Example:**

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  background-color: #f4f4f4;
}

.header {
  text-align: center;
  background-color: #333;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 20px;
}

.about,
.skills,
.contact {
  padding: 20px;
  margin: 20px auto;
  max-width: 800px;
}

form {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: #555;
}
```

- **Tips for Flexbox:**
  - To center elements within a section, use `justify-content: center` and `align-items: center` on the flex container.
  - To create horizontal navigation, use `flex-direction: row`.
