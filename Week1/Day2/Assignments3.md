#### AI Instruction:

You are expected to craft and use accurate and clear prompts to AI tools to learn each topic thoroughly. After understanding the concepts, proceed to solve the given problems. Make sure to experiment with the examples provided by the AI, and apply them to complete the exercises below. Focus on clarity and practice.

### Problem Statements

#### **1. Data Types**

1. **Problem Statement:** Declare a variable to store the name of a city and another variable to store its population (as an integer). Write Python code to display both variables with appropriate labels.

   - **Instructions:** Focus on correct data types (string and integer).

2. **Problem Statement:** You are given a float number representing the price of an item and a boolean indicating if the item is in stock. Declare these variables and print their values with descriptive labels.

   - **Instructions:** Practice working with float and boolean data types.

3. **Problem Statement:** Declare an integer representing the number of books on a shelf. Declare a string for the name of the book. Display both variables in a single print statement.

   - **Instructions:** Combine integers and strings in print statements.

4. **Problem Statement:** Create three variables: one for the number of rooms in a house, one for the area of the house (in square meters, as a float), and one boolean to check if the house is for sale. Print these variables.
   - **Instructions:** Practice combining different data types.

#### **2. Operators**

1. **Problem Statement:** You are given two numbers, `a = 15` and `b = 5`. Perform and display the results of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using these two numbers.

   - **Instructions:** Use basic arithmetic operators.

2. **Problem Statement:** Declare two numbers, `x = 10` and `y = 20`. Write Python code to compare if `x` is less than, greater than, or equal to `y` using comparison operators. Display the results.

   - **Instructions:** Practice using comparison operators.

3. **Problem Statement:** Given two boolean variables, `is_sunny = True` and `is_weekend = False`, use logical operators to check if it is sunny and a weekend or if it is either one. Print the results.

   - **Instructions:** Use logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`).

4. **Problem Statement:** Declare two numbers, `p = 50` and `q = 3`. Calculate and display the result of the modulus operator to find the remainder when `p` is divided by `q`.
   - **Instructions:** Focus on using the modulus operator (`%`).

#### **3. Conditional Statements**

1. **Problem Statement:** Declare a variable `temperature = 35`. Write a program that checks if the temperature is above 30 and prints "It's a hot day", otherwise print "It's not that hot".

   - **Instructions:** Use `if-else` statements.

2. **Problem Statement:** Declare a variable `age = 18`. Write a Python code to check if the person is old enough to vote (age 18 or above). Print "Eligible to vote" if the condition is met, otherwise print "Not eligible to vote".

   - **Instructions:** Practice simple `if-else` statements.

3. **Problem Statement:** You are given a variable `score = 75`. Write a Python program to check if the score is greater than 50 and print "Pass", otherwise print "Fail".
   - **Instructions:** Practice basic condition checks using `if-else`.

#### **4. Loops**

1. **Problem Statement:** Write a Python program that declares a variable `n = 5`. Use a `for` loop to print the numbers from 1 to `n`.

   - **Instructions:** Use a simple `for` loop with a range.

2. **Problem Statement:** Declare a variable `count = 3`. Use a `while` loop to print "Hello" three times.

   - **Instructions:** Implement a `while` loop based on the `count` variable.

3. **Problem Statement:** Declare a variable `n = 4`. Write Python code to print the first `n` even numbers using a `for` loop.
   - **Instructions:** Focus on looping and basic arithmetic (finding even numbers).

#### **5. Nested Loops**

1. **Problem Statement:** Declare two variables `rows = 3` and `cols = 4`. Use nested loops to print a rectangle made of `*` symbols with the specified number of rows and columns.

   - **Instructions:** Implement nested loops to draw the rectangle.

2. **Problem Statement:** Declare a variable `n = 3`. Write a program that uses a nested loop to print the numbers from 1 to `n` in each row.

   - **Instructions:** Nested loops should generate repeated sequences.

3. **Problem Statement:** Declare a variable `height = 3`. Use nested loops to print a triangle made of `*` symbols where each row contains the same number of symbols as its row number (first row has 1, second row has 2, etc.).
   - **Instructions:** Apply nested loops to control both rows and symbols per row.

### **Arrays**

1. **Problem Statement:** Declare an array `fruits` containing the names of five different fruits. Write a program to display the first and last fruit in the array.

   - **Instructions:** Practice accessing array elements by index.

2. **Problem Statement:** Declare an array `numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`. Write a program to calculate and print the sum of all numbers in the array.

   - **Instructions:** Use a loop to iterate through the array and calculate the sum.

3. **Problem Statement:** Create an array `colors` with four color names. Use a loop to print each color from the array on a new line.
   - **Instructions:** Focus on looping through an array and printing its elements.
