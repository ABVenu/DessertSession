  **2. Continue Learning JavaScript with AI**

  - **Objective:** Deepen understanding of JavaScript using AI tools, focusing on objects and functions.

  - **JavaScript Objects**

    - **Explanation**

      - **Declaration:** Objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs.
      - **Mutability:** Objects are mutable, meaning their properties can be changed after creation.

### **2. Continue Learning JavaScript with AI**

- **Objective:** Use AI tools to deepen understanding of JavaScript, specifically focusing on objects and functions.

  - **JavaScript Objects:**

    - **Explanation:**
      - **Declaration:** Objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs, where keys are strings and values can be any data type.
      - **Mutability:** Objects are mutable, meaning their properties can be changed after creation.
      - **Basic Inbuilt Functions:** Methods like `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, and `Object.entries()` can be used to interact with objects.
    - **Instructor’s Detailed Explanation:**

      - **Declaration:**
        ```javascript
        let person = {
          name: "John",
          age: 30,
          greet: function () {
            console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
          },
        };
        ```
        - **`person`** is an object with properties `name` and `age`, and a method `greet`.
      - **Accessing and Modifying Properties:**
        ```javascript
        console.log(person.name); // Output: John
        person.age = 31; // Modifies the age property
        console.log(person.age); // Output: 31
        ```
      - **Using Inbuilt Functions:**
        ```javascript
        console.log(Object.keys(person)); // Output: ["name", "age", "greet"]
        console.log(Object.values(person)); // Output: ["John", 31, function]
        console.log(Object.entries(person)); // Output: [["name", "John"], ["age", 31], ["greet", function]]
        ```

    - **Prompts for Learning JavaScript Objects:**

      - **Prompt for Declaration and Access:**
        "Explain how to create and access properties of an object in JavaScript. Provide an example where an object represents a person with a name and age property."

  - **JavaScript Functions:**

    - **Explanation:**
      - **Declaration:** Functions are declared using the `function` keyword. They can be named or anonymous and can be assigned to variables.
      - **Return Statement:** Functions return values using the `return` keyword. If no return statement is used, `undefined` is returned by default.
      - **Linking and Calling Functions:** Functions can call other functions and be invoked with different arguments.
    - **Instructor’s Detailed Explanation:**

      - **Function Declaration:**
        ```javascript
        function add(a, b) {
          return a + b;
        }
        ```
        - **`add`** is a function that takes two arguments and returns their sum.
      - **Function Call:**
        ```javascript
        let result = add(5, 3);
        console.log(result); // Output: 8
        ```
      - **Linking Functions:**

        ```javascript
        function multiply(a, b) {
          return a * b;
        }

        function calculate(a, b) {
          return add(a, multiply(a, b));
        }

        console.log(calculate(2, 3)); // Output: 8
        ```

        - **`calculate`** calls both `add` and `multiply` functions to produce a result.
