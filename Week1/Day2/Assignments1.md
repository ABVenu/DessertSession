### Problem Statements

### **Assignments on JavaScript Objects**

1. **Create and Access Object Properties**

   - **Question:** Create a JavaScript object named `book` with properties `title`, `author`, and `publishedYear`. Write code to access and print each property. Then, modify the `publishedYear` and print the updated object.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Title: The Hobbit
     Author: J.R.R. Tolkien
     Published Year: 1937
     Updated Published Year: 1954
     ```

2. **Add Methods to Objects**

   - **Question:** Define a JavaScript object `employee` with properties `name`, `position`, and `salary`. Add a method `raiseSalary(percentage)` that increases the salary by the given percentage. Test the method by increasing the salary of an employee by 10%.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Original Salary: 50000
     Updated Salary: 55000
     ```

3. **Nested Objects**

   - **Question:** Create a JavaScript object `university` with properties `name`, `location`, and `departments`. `departments` should be an array of department objects, each with `departmentName` and `head` properties. Write code to list all department names.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Departments: Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics
     ```

4. **Object Destructuring**

   - **Question:** Define a JavaScript object `car` with properties `make`, `model`, `year`, and `price`. Use object destructuring to extract `make` and `model` into separate variables and print them.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Make: Ford
     Model: Mustang
     ```

5. **Dynamic Object Properties**
   - **Question:** Create a JavaScript object `student` with dynamic properties for `name`, `age`, and `grade`. Use square bracket notation to add a new property `email` and then print all properties of the object.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Name: Alice
     Age: 21
     Grade: A
     Email: alice@example.com
     ```
