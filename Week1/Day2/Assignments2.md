### Problem Statements

### **Assignments on JavaScript Functions**

1. **Basic Function Declaration**

   - **Question:** Write a JavaScript function `subtract(a, b)` that returns the difference between two numbers. Test the function with various inputs and print the results.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     10 - 4 = 6
     15 - 7 = 8
     ```

2. **Function with Default Parameters**

   - **Question:** Define a JavaScript function `greet(name = "Guest")` that returns a greeting message. Test the function with and without passing a `name` parameter.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Hello, Guest!
     Hello, Alice!
     ```

3. **Function Expression**

   - **Question:** Create a function expression `divide` that divides two numbers and returns the result. Use this function to calculate the division of 20 by 4.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     20 / 4 = 5
     ```

4. **Callback Functions**

   - **Question:** Write a function `processNumbers(numbers, callback)` where `numbers` is an array of numbers and `callback` is a function that processes each number. Use `processNumbers` with a callback function that prints each number squared.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     1
     4
     9
     ```

5. **Anonymous Function in Array Method**
   - **Question:** Use the `map` method on an array of numbers to create a new array where each number is multiplied by 3. Use an anonymous function as the callback for the `map` method.
   - **Example Output:**
     ```
     Original Array: [1, 2, 3]
     New Array: [3, 6, 9]
     ```
