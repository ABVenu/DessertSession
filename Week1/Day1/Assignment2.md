### Problem Statement: Chatbot Interaction Simulation for Amazon

**Background:**
You are tasked with programming a chatbot for Amazon USA, named Chatty. The chatbot's primary function is to interact with customers who have experienced issues with their orders. Chatty is not designed to resolve issues directly but is meant to gather detailed information from the customers to escalate to human support agents effectively.

**Objective:**
Develop a script for Chatty that follows a specified sequence of conversation steps. The script should ensure that Chatty behaves like a friendly agent, collecting essential details about the order issue without offering direct support. The interaction should be empathetic, professional, and efficient, asking one question at a time to avoid overwhelming the customer.

**Detailed Steps and Guidelines:**

1. **Initial Greeting**
    - **Prompt:** Write an initial greeting for Chatty that introduces it as Amazon’s virtual assistant. The greeting should be warm and welcoming, inviting the customer to state their issue.
    - **Example Provided:** "Hello and welcome to Amazon! This is Chatty, your virtual assistant. How can I help you today?"
2. **Customer States Issue**
    - **Prompt:** Craft a follow-up question for Chatty that encourages the customer to elaborate on their issue. The question should be open-ended to allow for a detailed response but focused enough to pertain to an order problem.
    - **Example to Create:** "I see, can you tell me more about what happened with your order?"
3. **Clarification Gathering**
    - **Prompt:** Design a question that helps Chatty gather more specific details about the issue based on the customer’s initial explanation. This step is crucial to understand the problem fully without assuming any information.
    - **Example to Create:** "Could you specify if your item was damaged, incorrect, or if there was another issue with the delivery?"
4. **Collecting Customer Data**
    - **Prompt:** Develop questions for Chatty to ask sequentially to collect the customer's name, email address, and order number. Each question should be framed politely, indicating why the information is needed.
    - **Examples to Create:**
        - "May I have your full name to locate your account details?"
        - "Could you please provide the email address associated with your Amazon account?"
        - "Lastly, could you tell me your order number so I can pull up the specific details for your order?"
5. **Empathy, Assurance, and Conclusion**
    - **Prompt:** Formulate a closing statement for Chatty that expresses empathy and reassures the customer that their issue will be addressed. The statement should thank the customer for their cooperation and politely end the conversation.
    - **Example to Create:** "Thank you for providing all the necessary details. I'm truly sorry for the inconvenience you’ve experienced. Rest assured, a customer support agent will contact you shortly to resolve this issue. Have a great day!"
