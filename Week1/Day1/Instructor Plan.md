### Part B Instructor Session Content/Notes

### 1. **Brief Introduction to AI**

- **What is AI?**
  - Define Artificial Intelligence (AI) as machines or software that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence (e.g., learning, reasoning, problem-solving).
- **How AI Works:**
  - Explain how AI models use data to learn patterns, make predictions, and generate human-like responses.
  - Mention techniques like Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) as common AI tools.
- **Applications of Generative AI:**
  - Content creation (text, image, audio generation).
  - Personalized learning experiences.
  - Automation of customer support and chatbot interactions.
  - Research assistance, code generation, and debugging.
- **AI in Daily Life:**
  - Discuss how individuals can utilize AI tools like chatbots, virtual assistants, or AI-driven platforms to improve productivity, learn new skills, or automate tasks.

### 2. **Introduction to Prompt Engineering**

- **What is Prompting?**
  - Define a "prompt" as an instruction or input given to an AI model that helps it generate a specific response.
- **How AI Responds to Prompting:**
  - Explain how different prompts can affect the quality of AI outputs. Better inputs lead to more relevant and accurate responses.
- **Characteristics of Good Prompts (The Art of Writing Effective Prompts):**
  - **Clarity:** Clear and concise instructions help avoid confusion.
  - **Simplicity:** Avoid unnecessary details or complex language.
  - **Context:** Provide sufficient background information to guide the AI’s response.
  - **Precision:** Be specific in your requests to get the desired output.
  - **Avoiding Ambiguity:** Ensure there’s no room for misinterpretation.

### 3. **Effective Prompting**

- **Good vs. Bad Prompts:**
  - Demonstrate the differences between good and bad prompts using practical examples across various scenarios (content creation, customer support, education, etc.).
  - Show how poor prompts can lead to irrelevant or unclear responses, while good prompts lead to more targeted and helpful outcomes.
- **Sample Scenarios for Practice:**  
  Provide students time to craft their prompts based on the following examples. Encourage them to compare the results of both good and bad prompts.

  **Scenario 1: Content Creation**

  - **Task:** Create a headline for a blog post about sustainable fashion trends in 2024.
  - **Bad Prompt:** "Write a headline."
  - **Good Prompt:** "Create a catchy headline for a blog post about sustainable fashion trends in 2024, targeting eco-conscious readers."

  **Scenario 2: Customer Support**

  - **Task:** Respond empathetically to a frustrated customer whose system crashed after a software update.
  - **Bad Prompt:** "Talk to a customer."
  - **Good Prompt:** "Respond empathetically to a customer frustrated by a system crash after a recent software update, apologizing and offering a clear solution."

  **Scenario 3: Educational Content**

  - **Task:** Explain photosynthesis to an 8th-grade science class.
  - **Bad Prompt:** "Explain photosynthesis."
  - **Good Prompt:** "Explain photosynthesis in simple terms suitable for an 8th-grade science class, focusing on its importance for plants."

  **Scenario 4: Creative Writing**

  - **Task:** Describe an ancient, magical artifact found in a temple.
  - **Bad Prompt:** "Write about an artifact."
  - **Good Prompt:** "Describe a mysterious artifact found in an ancient temple, emphasizing its magical properties to intrigue fantasy readers."

  **Scenario 5: Coding Assistance**

  - **Task:** Debug a Python code snippet returning an unexpected error.
  - **Bad Prompt:** "Fix this code."
