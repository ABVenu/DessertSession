    - Difference = (new Date("2024-09-01") - new Date("2024-08-01")) / (1000 _ 60 _ 60 \* 24) = 31 days
  - **JavaScript Function**:
    ```javascript
    function calculateDateDifference(date1, date2) {
      const diffTime = Math.abs(new Date(date1) - new Date(date2));
      return Math.ceil(diffTime / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
    }
    ```

- **Formatting Dates and Times**:

  - **JavaScript**: `date.toLocaleDateString()`, `date.toLocaleTimeString()`
  - **Example**: `new Date().toLocaleDateString()` returns "09/18/2024", `new Date().toLocaleTimeString()` returns "10:30:00 AM"
  - **JavaScript Function**:

    ```javascript
    function formatDate(date) {
      return date.toLocaleDateString();
