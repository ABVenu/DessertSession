#### Submission Guidelines

## **Please Solve all the question in a single file on One Compiler [Link](https://onecompiler.com/javascript), Save it with proper naming, Run It and Submit the One Complier Link, Please Ensure Code visiblity is Public**

### **Instructions for All Questions**:

1. Understand the problem statement.
2. Plan the solution using pseudo-code or a flowchart (include in comments).
3. Write the code to solve the problem.
4. Test your solution with multiple inputs.

1. **Check for Even or Odd**  
   Write a program that checks whether a given number is even or odd.  
   **Instructions**: Write all the steps involved (understanding the problem, plan/pseudo-code in commented format) before coding.  
   **Hint**: Use the modulus operator (`%`).

   **Test Cases**:

   - Normal: Input: `4` → Output: `Even`
   - Normal: Input: `7` → Output: `Odd`
   - Edge: Input: `0` → Output: `Even`
   - Edge: Input: `-3` → Output: `Odd`

2. **Sum of Numbers in an Array**  
   Write a program that calculates the sum of all the numbers in a given array.  
   **Instructions**: Write the problem-solving steps and include the pseudo-code in comments before writing the program.

   **Test Cases**:

   - Normal: Input: `[1, 2, 3]` → Output: `6`
   - Normal: Input: `[-1, -2, -3]` → Output: `-6`
   - Edge: Input: `[]` → Output: `0`
   - Edge: Input: `[0]` → Output: `0`

3. **Find the Maximum Number in an Array**  
   Write a program that finds the largest number in a given array.  
   **Instructions**: Break down the problem, write the steps, and create pseudo-code in comments before coding.

   **Test Cases**:

   - Normal: Input: `[1, 2, 3]` → Output: `3`
   - Normal: Input: `[-5, -1, -10]` → Output: `-1`
   - Edge: Input: `[5]` → Output: `5`
   - Edge: Input: `[]` → Output: `null` (or some indication of no maximum)

---

4. **Check for Positive, Negative, or Zero**  
   Write a program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.  
   **Instructions**: Write the steps involved in solving the problem and include the pseudo-code in comments before implementing the code.

   **Test Cases**:

   - Normal: Input: `3` → Output: `Positive`
   - Normal: Input: `-1` → Output: `Negative`
   - Edge: Input: `0` → Output: `Zero`

---

5. **Count Odd Numbers in an Array**  
   Write a program that counts how many odd numbers are present in a given array.  
   **Instructions**: Write the steps for solving the problem, create pseudo-code in comments, and then write the code.

   **Test Cases**:

   - Normal: Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` → Output: `3`
   - Normal: Input: `[2, 4, 6]` → Output: `0`
   - Edge: Input: `[]` → Output: `0`
   - Edge: Input: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]` → Output: `5`
