#### Submission Guidelines

## **Please Solve all the question in a single file on One Compiler [Link](https://onecompiler.com/javascript), Save it with proper naming, Run It and Submit the One Complier Link, Please Ensure Code visiblity is Public**

### **Instructions for All Questions**:

1. Understand the problem statement.
2. Plan the solution using pseudo-code or a flowchart (include in comments).
3. Write the code to solve the problem.
4. Test your solution with multiple inputs.

1. **Find the Second Largest Number in an Array**  
   Write a program to find the second-largest number in a given array.  
   **Instructions**: Write the steps to solve the problem and include pseudo-code in comments before coding.  
   **Hint**: You may need to traverse the array twice or use a temporary variable.

   **Test Cases**:

   - Normal: Input: `[1, 2, 3]` → Output: `2`
   - Normal: Input: `[5, 1, 2, 4, 3]` → Output: `4`
   - Edge: Input: `[3, 3, 3]` → Output: `null` (or some indication of no second largest)
   - Edge: Input: `[1]` → Output: `null`

2. **Reverse a String**  
   Write a program that takes a string and reverses it.  
   **Instructions**: Break down the problem-solving steps and create pseudo-code in comments before implementing the solution.  
   **Hint**: Loop through the string from the last character to the first.

   **Test Cases**:

   - Normal: Input: `"hello"` → Output: `"olleh"`
   - Normal: Input: `"OpenAI"` → Output: `"IAnepO"`
   - Edge: Input: `""` → Output: `""` (empty string)
   - Edge: Input: `"a"` → Output: `"a"` (single character)

3. **Find the Intersection of Two Arrays**  
   Write a program that finds the common elements (intersection) between two given arrays.  
   **Instructions**: Write the problem-solving process and add pseudo-code in comments before writing the code.

   **Test Cases**:

   - Normal: Input: `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 4]` → Output: `[2, 3]`
   - Normal: Input: `[1, 5, 7]`, `[2, 3, 4]` → Output: `[]`
   - Edge: Input: `[]`, `[1, 2, 3]` → Output: `[]`
   - Edge: Input: `[1, 1, 2]`, `[1, 2, 2]` → Output: `[1, 2]` (considering duplicates)

4. **Sort an Array Using Bubble Sort**  
   Implement the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of numbers in ascending order.  
   **Instructions**: Break the problem into steps, write pseudo-code in comments, and then implement the solution.  
   **Hint**: Compare adjacent elements and swap if they are in the wrong order.

   **Test Cases**:

   - Normal: Input: `[3, 1, 2]` → Output: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Normal: Input: `[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]` → Output: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`
   - Edge: Input: `[]` → Output: `[]`
   - Edge: Input: `[1]` → Output: `[1]`

5. **Find the Majority Element in an Array**  
    Write a program to find the element that appears more than half the time in a given array. If no such element exists, return `null`.  
    **Instructions**: Write down the steps to solve this problem and include pseudo-code in comments before coding.  
    **Hint**: You may use a counting technique or sorting to solve this.

   **Test Cases**:

- Normal: Input: `[3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4]` → Output: `4`
- Normal: Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4]` → Output: `null`
- Edge: Input: `[1, 1, 2, 2, 1]` → Output: `1`
- Edge: Input: `[]` → Output: `null`
