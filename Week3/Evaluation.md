   - **Color Palette**: Use any color palette generator (such as [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) or [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/)) to extract colors from the image or `any Color Picker extension in the Chrome browser` and recreate the same shades in your design.
   - **Alignment and Spacing**: Ensure that all elements are properly aligned and that there is consistent spacing between them.
   - **Hierarchy and Visual Flow**: Make sure the visual hierarchy guides the viewer's eye smoothly through the design, focusing on key elements first.

#### 3. **Precision**: 
Strive to replicate the details of the original as closely as possible, paying attention to proportions, spacing, alignment, and design elements, size of the total image, **each and every component can be fixed by you on your eye judgement**.
