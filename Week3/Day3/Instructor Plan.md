---

### **Session Flow:**

#### **1. Introduction to Figma (15 mins)**

- **Objective:** Introduce students to Figma, its interface, and key features.
- **What to do:**
  - Start by playing a short overview video on Figma (5 mins).
  - Live demo: Open Figma in the browser and demonstrate the sign-up process.
  - Walk students through the Figma interface:
    - Sidebar (where Layers, Assets are located).
    - Toolbar (for adding shapes, text, etc.).
    - Properties panel (for styling components like color, size, position).
- **Key Points:**

  - Figma is a powerful, collaborative, and free design tool used for UI/UX design and prototyping.
  - Introduction to its features: cloud-based tool, live collaboration, and vector-based design.

- **Tools:**
  - Figma (https://figma.com)
  - YouTube or pre-recorded video for demo purposes.

#### **2. Understanding Figma's Basic Tools (15 mins)**

- **Objective:** Teach students how to use essential tools in Figma: Frames, Shapes, Text, and Layers.

- **What to do:**

  - Live demonstration:
    - **Frames:** Explain how to create frames (similar to artboards in other design tools) for different devices (desktop, mobile, etc.).
    - **Shapes:** Demonstrate how to use the shape tool to create basic shapes like rectangles, circles, and lines.
    - **Text:** Show how to add text and adjust typography properties like font size, style, alignment.
    - **Layers:** Explain how layers work in Figma, showing how elements are stacked and organized.
  - Students follow along by replicating the steps and experimenting with the tools.

- **Key Points:**

  - Frames are the containers for the design, representing different screen sizes (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop).
  - Layers are crucial for organizing components in your design.
  - Shapes and Text are the core building blocks of UI design.

- **Tools:**
  - Figma (live demo and hands-on practice).

#### **3. Creating Basic UI Components and a Navbar (50 mins)**

- **Objective:** Guide students through creating basic UI components such as buttons, text fields, icons, and a navigation bar, while emphasizing design principles like consistency and alignment.

- **What to do:**
  - **Step-by-step live demo:**
    - **Button Creation:**
      - Draw a rectangle for the button background.
      - Add text on top using the text tool (e.g., “Submit”).
      - Customize the button by adjusting color, border radius, and shadow.
    - **Text Field Creation:**
      - Create a rectangle for the input field.
      - Add placeholder text (e.g., “Enter your email”).
      - Adjust the border, fill, and text size for a clean look.
    - **Icon Creation:**
      - Use simple shapes to create icons (e.g., a home icon with a square and a triangle).
      - Show how to group elements together to create a cohesive icon.
    - **Navigation Bar Creation:**
      - Create a horizontal frame (or rectangle) at the top of the design as the navbar background.
      - Add navigation links (e.g., Home, About, Contact) using the text tool.
      - Create a logo or simple icon to place on the left side of the navbar.
      - Align the navigation links and logo with consistent spacing.
      - Use colors that provide clear contrast to ensure readability.
  - **Students follow along**:
    - Provide 20 minutes for students to create their own versions of buttons, text fields, icons, and a navigation bar.
    - Encourage experimentation with colors, fonts, and styles.
- **Key Points:**

  - Buttons should have clear labels and visually stand out, guiding user interaction.
  - Text fields must be clearly labeled, with appropriate placeholder text for better usability.
  - Icons should be simple and easily recognizable.
  - **Navbar Design Tips:**
    - Keep the layout clean with proper alignment and spacing.
    - Ensure the navigation links are clear and easily clickable.
    - Maintain consistent branding with the logo and design of the navbar.
  - **Emphasize Design Principles:**
    - **Consistency:** Ensure that all buttons, text fields, and icons follow a consistent style throughout the UI.
    - **Alignment and Spacing:** Maintain equal spacing between components and align them properly for a clean, professional look.
    - **Hierarchy:** Use font size, color contrast, and layout to establish a clear visual hierarchy (e.g., make buttons bold and easily clickable).

- **Tools:**
  - Figma (live demo and hands-on practice).

#### **4. Recap and Q&A (10 mins)**

- **Objective:** Review the key concepts learned in the session and address any questions from students.

- **What to do:**

  - Recap the basic Figma tools: Frames, Shapes, Text, Layers, and UI components.
  - Review the process of creating UI components and a navigation bar.
  - Ask students if they encountered any difficulties or have questions regarding their designs.
  - Show a few student designs (if time permits) and provide constructive feedback.

- **Key Points:**

  - Ensure students are comfortable using the basic tools in Figma.
  - Emphasize practicing consistency and alignment in their designs.

- **Tools:**
  - Figma (for review and feedback).

---

### **Additional Notes for the Instructor:**

- Before the session, ensure students have set up their Figma accounts and have some basic familiarity with the tool.
- Provide feedback on student designs, focusing on their understanding of the basic tools and the application of design principles (consistency, alignment, and spacing).
- Encourage students to practice building more components on their own, such as navigation bars, forms, and icons, to reinforce their understanding.

### Part B Instructor Session Content/Notes

### **Instructor Notes Overview:**

1. **Tools Required:**

   - **Figma**: Ensure that students have an active Figma account before the session. If some students have not registered, guide them through the process of signing up at [https://www.figma.com](https://www.figma.com).
   - **YouTube/Figma Tutorials**: Have short introductory videos ready to show the basics of Figma (optional).
   - **Pre-prepared Figma File**: Prepare a file with sample components (buttons, text fields, icons, etc.) to use during the live demo.

---

### **3. Creating Basic UI Components & Navbar (50 mins)**

**Goal:** Guide students through building practical UI components and a navigation bar, while teaching design principles.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Button Creation** (10 mins):

   - **What to do**:
     - Create a rectangle.
     - Add a text label (“Submit” or “Click Me”) inside.
     - Show how to adjust button size, color, and text alignment.
     - Discuss design considerations like spacing, padding, and color contrast for accessibility.
   - **Why**: Buttons are key interaction points, so they must be clear and visually engaging.

2. **Text Field Creation** (10 mins):

   - **What to do**:
     - Create a rectangle for the input field.
     - Add placeholder text like “Enter your email.”
     - Adjust border color, text alignment, and padding.
   - **Why**: Form elements like text fields are vital in user interaction, so their design must be clean and easy to use.

3. **Icon Creation** (10 mins):

   - **What to do**:
     - Demonstrate how to combine basic shapes to create simple icons (e.g., home icon, search icon).
     - Group shapes into a single component and resize it.
   - **Why**: Icons enhance the user interface by providing visual cues for navigation and action.

4. **Navigation Bar (Navbar) Creation** (20 mins):

   - **What to do**:
     - Create a horizontal rectangle (for the navbar background).
     - Add navigation links (e.g., “Home,” “About,” “Services,” “Contact”) using the text tool.
     - Include a logo or simple icon to the left side of the navbar.
     - Show how to adjust alignment and ensure consistent spacing between links.
   - **Why**: The navbar is the backbone of any user interface, guiding users through the site or app. The design must be intuitive, with clear links and proper spacing.

**Tips to Share:** - **Consistency**: Ensure all buttons, text fields, and icons follow a consistent style (e.g., same font, same color scheme). - **Alignment**: Always align components for a professional look. - **Color contrast**: Text and buttons must be easy to read and click, even for users with visual impairments.

**Tools:** - **Figma Basic Tools**: Frame, Rectangle, Text, Grouping for icons, and Components. - Share a Figma file template with partially completed components as a reference if students struggle.
