### Student Notes:

# Figma Basics

#### **Objective:**

By the end of this session, you will learn the basics of Figma, how to create UI components (like buttons, text fields, and icons), and how to design a navigation bar (navbar).

### **1. Introduction to Figma**

- **Figma Overview**:

  - Figma is a cloud-based design tool used for creating **UI/UX designs**.
  - It is **vector-based**, meaning designs are scalable and won’t lose quality.
  - You can access and work on your designs from any device, and your work is automatically saved.

- **Figma Interface**:

  - **Frames**: Figma’s version of artboards (where you create your designs).
  - **Layers**: Helps keep your elements organized, showing the hierarchy of your design objects.
  - **Toolbar**: Contains tools to draw shapes, insert text, and more.
  - **Properties Panel**: Allows you to adjust the color, size, border, etc., of your design components.

- **Why Figma?**
  - It’s a go-to tool for **prototyping, designing**, and **collaborating** on web and mobile app interfaces.
  - Simple to use, with real-time collaboration features and many pre-made design resources.

### **2. Figma's Basic Tools**

- **Shapes**:
  - You can create rectangles, circles, lines, etc., which form the basis of buttons, fields, and icons.
- **Text**:

  - Use the text tool to create labels, titles, or any text-based UI element.
  - You can adjust fonts, colors, sizes, and alignment.

- **Layers**:

  - Think of **Layers** as an organized system that stacks objects one on top of another. Layers help you manage complex designs.

- **Frames**:
  - Frames act as containers for your designs, allowing you to design for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

### **3. Creating Basic UI Components**

#### **Button Design:**

- **Steps**:

  1. Create a rectangle using the **shape** tool.
  2. Insert a text label inside the rectangle (e.g., "Click Me").
  3. Customize the button: adjust color, size, and text alignment.
  4. Group the text and the shape to ensure they move together.

- **Design Tips**:
  - **Spacing**: Leave enough padding around the text inside the button.
  - **Color Contrast**: Ensure your button’s color contrasts with the text for readability.

#### **Text Field Design:**

- **Steps**:

  1. Create a rectangle to represent the text input area.
  2. Add placeholder text (e.g., “Enter your email”).
  3. Customize the border and size.

- **Design Tips**:
  - Text fields should be large enough for the user to comfortably enter information.
  - Use clear, simple fonts for readability.

#### **Icon Design:**

- **Steps**:
  1. Combine basic shapes (rectangles, circles, lines) to form a simple icon (e.g., home icon).
  2. Group these shapes to create a unified icon.
- **Design Tips**:
  - Keep icons simple and recognizable.
  - Use consistent sizes and alignment with text and buttons.

### **4. Creating a Navigation Bar (Navbar)**

- **Steps**:

  1. Create a horizontal rectangle for the navbar’s background.
  2. Add text for the navigation links (e.g., "Home", "About", "Services", "Contact").
  3. Add a logo or icon to the left side of the navbar.
  4. Adjust the alignment of the links and logo, ensuring even spacing.

- **Design Tips**:
  - **Consistency**: Keep fonts and colors consistent across the navbar for a clean look.
  - **Spacing**: Ensure there is enough space between the navigation links to make them easy to click.
  - **Responsiveness**: When designing, keep in mind that navbars should work well on different screen sizes.

### **5. Key Design Principles for UI Components**

- **Consistency**:
  - Ensure that all UI elements (buttons, text fields, icons, and navbars) follow a consistent design pattern, including colors, fonts, and spacing.
- **Alignment**:
  - Align elements properly to maintain a professional and clean design.
- **Hierarchy**:

  - Establish a clear visual hierarchy to guide users. Important buttons and text should stand out.

- **Accessibility**:
  - Use color contrast to ensure that text on buttons and fields is easy to read for all users, including those with visual impairments.

### **6. Tools for Design:**

- **Figma**:
  - The main tool used for this session. You can access it at [https://www.figma.com](https://www.figma.com).
- **Resources for Icons and Typography**:

  - **Icons**: You can find free icons on [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/) or use Figma's built-in icon libraries.
  - **Typography**: Google Fonts is a great resource for free fonts that you can use in your designs. Visit [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

- **Color Palettes**:
  - Use [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) or [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create) to generate color palettes for your designs.

### **7. Homework Assignment:**

- Using **Figma**, create a simple webpage layout that includes:
  1.  A navigation bar with at least four links (Home, About, Services, Contact).
  2.  Two text fields (e.g., Name and Email input).
  3.  One button (e.g., Submit).
  4.  Add a simple logo to the top left of the page.
