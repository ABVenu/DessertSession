Here are the solutions to the assignment questions based on **Figma Basics and UI/UX Components**:

---

### **1. Solution: Create a Button with Hover State in Figma**

- **Step 1**: Open a new Figma file and create a button by drawing a rectangle with the shape tool.
  - Set the button size (e.g., 120px width x 40px height).
  - Add text inside the button (e.g., "Submit") and center it vertically and horizontally.
- **Step 2**: Style the button with a background color (e.g., blue) and add a border-radius for rounded corners (e.g., 6px).
- **Step 3**: Duplicate the button to create a hover state. 
  - Change the background color (e.g., to a darker shade of blue) for the hover effect.
  - Use Figma's **Prototype** feature to connect the original button to the hover state, simulating a hover interaction.
- **Tools Used**: Figma.

### **2. Solution: Design a Simple Form with Two Text Fields and a Submit Button**

- **Step 1**: Create two rectangles for text fields (e.g., 300px width x 40px height). Label one as "Name" and the other as "Email."
- **Step 2**: Below the text fields, create a button following the same steps as the previous solution.
  - Place text in the button, such as "Submit."
  - Ensure the button is centered relative to the text fields.
- **Step 3**: Align the text fields and button vertically with even spacing (e.g., 20px gap).
  - Add placeholders inside the text fields (e.g., "Enter your name").
- **Tools Used**: Figma.

### **3. Solution: Build a Navigation Bar (Navbar) with Icons**

- **Step 1**: Create a navbar by drawing a rectangle that spans the width of the page (e.g., 1440px width x 60px height).
  - Set a background color for the navbar (e.g., light grey or dark blue).
- **Step 2**: Add text for the navigation links (e.g., "Home," "About," "Contact"). Use Google Fonts or any other font source to ensure the typography matches your design theme.
  - Align the links horizontally with even spacing (e.g., 100px gap between each).
- **Step 3**: Download icons from the **Noun Project** or any other icon source. Place the icons to the left of the text links.
  - Ensure each icon is aligned with the text and sized appropriately (e.g., 20px x 20px).
  - Make sure the links and icons are centered vertically within the navbar.
- **Tools Used**: Figma, Noun Project for icons.

### **4. Solution: Create a Logo and Add It to a Navigation Bar**

- **Step 1**: Use **Figma's Text Tool** to design a simple logo. You can combine text (e.g., "MyBrand") with a custom shape (e.g., a circle or square) to make it visually distinct.
  - Experiment with fonts from **Google Fonts** to create a unique logo style.
- **Step 2**: Place the logo on the far left side of the navbar, ensuring it is aligned with the other navigation elements.
  - Adjust the size of the logo to fit appropriately in the navbar (e.g., 120px width x 40px height).
- **Step 3**: Align the logo with the navigation links so that they share the same vertical center.
- **Tools Used**: Figma, Google Fonts.

### **5. Solution: Design a Mobile Version of Your Navigation Bar**

- **Step 1**: Duplicate your existing desktop navbar in Figma.
  - Resize the navbar to fit a mobile screen width (e.g., 320px width).
- **Step 2**: Instead of having all links visible, use a **hamburger menu** icon (three horizontal lines) on the top right to represent the navigation.
  - Create a simple hamburger icon using three horizontal rectangles (2px height x 20px width), spaced evenly.
- **Step 3**: When the hamburger icon is clicked, show a vertical list of links (e.g., "Home," "About," "Contact"). Ensure these links are large enough for mobile interaction (e.g., 50px height per link with 16px font size).
- **Tools Used**: Figma.

### **Notes for Submission**:

- Ensure that all designs are neatly aligned, follow consistent spacing rules, and are visually clear.
- Use Figma's **Auto Layout** and **Constraints** features for responsive design.
- For typography, refer to **Google Fonts** and consider accessibility (font size, legibility).
- Use color contrast tools like [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to ensure your text is readable on all backgrounds.
- Export each design as **PNG** or **share the Figma file** link for submission.

These solutions cover key aspects of basic UI/UX design using Figma, ensuring a clear understanding of layout, alignment, interaction, and mobile responsiveness.
