Identify the types of fonts used (serif, sans-serif, or display) and discuss how they contribute to the overall design and user experience. Provide specific examples of font sizes, weights, and styles used.
   - **Tools:** Use **WhatFont** (a browser extension) to identify fonts on websites.

2. **Spacing and Alignment Exercise:**

   - Take a piece of content (e.g., a short article) and format it using proper spacing and alignment principles. Adjust margins, padding, line height, and letter spacing to enhance readability. Include before and after screenshots of your formatting changes.
   - **Tools:** Use any word processing tool (e.g., **Google Docs**, **Microsoft Word**) or design software (e.g., **Figma**, **Adobe InDesign**).

3. **Brand Guidelines Development:**

   - Create a mini brand guideline document for a fictional company. Include sections on logo usage, typography (fonts and hierarchy), color palette, and imagery style. Use examples to illustrate your guidelines and explain why consistency is important for branding.
   - **Tools:** Use **Canva**, **Adobe Illustrator**, or **Figma** to design your brand guideline document.

4. **Critical Design Review:**

   - Find a poorly designed website or app (e.g., **XYZ News** or another of your choice). Write a critique of the design, focusing on typography, layout, color usage, spacing, and alignment. Provide specific examples of what could be improved and how those improvements would enhance the user experience.

   - **Tools:** Use **Google Scholar** or **Medium** to find articles on design psychology.

7. **Inspiration Board Creation:**
   - Create a mood board for a fictional brand that includes typography, color palette, images, and layout examples that reflect the brand's identity. Discuss how each element supports the brand's message and overall aesthetic.
